            <h2>How Did He Help?</h2>

            <h2>Impact of Sugihara's Actions</h2>
            <p>The visas issued by Sugihara allowed over 6,000 Jewish refugees to travel through Japan to safety. Many of these individuals went on to settle in the United States, Canada, and other countries, contributing to society in numerous ways.</p>
            <p>Sugihara's courageous actions were recognized posthumously, and in 1985, he was named "Righteous Among the Nations" by Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the Holocaust.</p>
